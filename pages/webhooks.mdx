# Webhooks

### What are Webhooks?

A **webhook** is a method for one application to provide real-time data to another application. 

Unlike traditional APIs where you need to poll for data, webhooks allow you to receive data as soon as an event occurs in a **push** fashion. 

This is achieved by setting up a URL endpoint that the webhook provider can send HTTP requests to whenever a specified event happens.

### When to use?

Use webhooks to receive real-time updates and automate workflows. They are particularly useful for integrating different 
services and applications, such as receiving notifications for new user registrations, payment transactions, or updates to a database.

### How does it work?

When an event occurs in the webhook provider's system, it sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL endpoint 
with a payload containing the event data. The receiving application can then process this data and take appropriate actions.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Receive data instantly as events occur, eliminating the need for polling.
- **Automation**: Automate workflows by triggering actions in response to specific events.
- **Integration**: Easily integrate different services and applications by setting up webhooks to communicate between them.

### Common Use Cases

- **Notifications**: Receive real-time notifications for events such as new user registrations, form submissions, or payment transactions.
- **Data Synchronization**: Keep data synchronized between different systems by receiving updates whenever data changes.
- **Automated Workflows**: Trigger automated workflows in response to specific events, such as sending an email when a new user signs up or updating a CRM system when a sale is made.

### Example of Setting Up a Webhook

Here is an example of setting up a webhook endpoint using Express and Node.js:

```javascript copy
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  // Process the event data
  console.log('Received event:', event);

  // Respond to the webhook provider
  res.status(200).send('Event received');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
