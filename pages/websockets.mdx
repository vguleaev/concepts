# WebSockets

### What are WebSockets?

**WebSockets** are a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are half-duplex and require a new connection for each request/response pair, WebSockets allow for continuous, bidirectional communication.

### When to use?

Use WebSockets for applications that require real-time, low-latency communication between the client and server. Common use cases include chat applications, live sports updates, online gaming, and collaborative editing tools.

### How does it work?

When a client (such as a web browser or mobile app) establishes a WebSocket connection with a server, the connection remains open, allowing both the client and server to send and receive messages at any time. This is achieved through a WebSocket handshake, which upgrades an HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.

### Key Features

- **Full-Duplex Communication**: Allows for simultaneous, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **Low Latency**: Provides real-time communication with minimal delay, making it ideal for applications that require instant updates.
- **Persistent Connection**: Maintains a single, long-lived connection, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for each message.
- **Efficient Data Transfer**: Uses a lightweight protocol with minimal overhead, making it more efficient than traditional HTTP requests for frequent data exchanges.

### Common Use Cases

- **Chat Applications**: Enable real-time messaging between users with instant delivery of messages.
- **Live Sports Updates**: Provide real-time scores and updates for live sports events.
- **Online Gaming**: Facilitate real-time communication between players in multiplayer online games.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Allow multiple users to edit documents simultaneously with real-time updates.

### Example of Setting Up a WebSocket Server

Here is an example of setting up a WebSocket server using Node.js and the `ws` library:

```javascript copy
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

server.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('Client connected');

  socket.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log('Received:', message);
    // Echo the message back to the client
    socket.send(`Server: ${message}`);
  });

  socket.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

console.log('WebSocket server running at ws://localhost:8080');
```

In this example, the WebSocket server listens for connections on port 8080. When a client connects, the server logs 
the connection and sets up event handlers for receiving messages and handling disconnections. The server echoes received messages back to the client.

### Popular WebSocket Libraries

- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/): A popular library that provides a simple and robust API for WebSocket communication, with fallback options for older browsers.
- [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws): A lightweight and efficient WebSocket library for Node.js.
- [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client): A JavaScript library that provides a WebSocket-like API with fallback options for environments that do not support WebSockets.

### WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- **WebSocket**: Provides full-duplex communication over a single connection, allowing for bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **Server-Sent Events**: Provides one-way communication from the server to the client, allowing the server to push updates to the client. 
SSE is simpler to set up than WebSockets but does not support bidirectional communication.
