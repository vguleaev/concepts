# API Pagination

### What is a Pagination?

**Pagination** is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages.

### When to use?

When API need to return **large data sets**, it is recommended to use pagination to improve performance, reduce response times, 
and prevent overloading the client with too much data at once.

### Types of Pagination

- **Offset-Based Pagination**: This method uses an offset parameter or page number to specify the starting point of the data set to be returned. 
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: This method uses a cursor (such as an ID or timestamp) to specify the starting point of the data set to be returned. 

### Offset-Based Pagination 

In offset-based pagination, the client specifies the number of items to skip (**offset**) and the number of items to return (**limit**) in each request.

```http
GET /api/items?offset=20&limit=10
```

Alternatively, you can use **page** and **page size** parameters instead.

```http
GET /api/items?page=3&page_size=10
```

When implementing page-based pagination, it is often useful to return the total count of items or the total number of pages.

A SQL database query for offset-based pagination might look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY id 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

A database in this case will skip the first 20 rows and return the next 10 rows.

Offset-based pagination is perfect to deal with small datasets. However, it has some **limitations** when dealing with large datasets. 
Your database have to count and skip rows up to offset before returning the actual result. 

**The larger your offset, the more inefficient** the query becomes.


**Pros:**
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Allows users to jump to a specific page without having to load all previous pages.

**Cons:**
- Results can be inconsistent if data is added or removed during pagination.
- Performance can degrade as the offset increases, especially with large data sets.

### Cursor-Based Pagination

In cursor-based pagination, the client specifies a **cursor** (such as an ID or timestamp) that points to a specific item in the data set.

This technique addresses the problems of offset-based pagination by using a stable cursor to navigate through the data set and avoiding the need to skip rows.

```http
GET /api/items?cursor=abc123&limit=10
```

The response includes a set of items together with a **next cursor** to retrieve the next page.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": "item1"},
    {"id": "item2"},
    ...
  ],
  "next_cursor": "def456"
}
```

The client need to use the **next cursor** to fetch the next set of items. It is basically a pointer that server can use to improve performance.

The cursor value can be anything that can be used to identify the next set of items. A common practice is to use the **ID** or a **timestamp**.

A SQL database query for cursor-based pagination might look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items 
WHERE id > 'abc123'
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10;
```

**Indexing** the column used for cursor-based pagination is crucial for query performance.

**Pros:**
- Better performance for large data sets.
- Consistent results even if data is added or removed during pagination.

**Cons:**
- Client need to keep track of the cursor value.
- Client need to traverse the pages sequentially. Cannot jump to a specific page directly.
- Requires a stable cursor value.

### Offset vs Cursor Pagination

- **Offset Pagination:** Suitable for smaller datasets or where direct access to a specific page is required.
- **Cursor Pagination:** Suitable for larger datasets or where consistent results are critical and traversing sequentially is acceptable.
