# API Pagination

### What is a Pagination?

**Pagination** is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages.

### When to use?

When API need to return **large data sets**, it is recommended to use pagination to improve performance, reduce response times, 
and prevent overloading the client with too much data at once.

### Types of Pagination

- **Offset-Based Pagination**: This method uses an offset parameter or page number to specify the starting point of the data set to be returned. 
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: This method uses a cursor (such as an ID or timestamp) to specify the starting point of the data set to be returned. 

### Offset-Based Pagination 

In offset-based pagination, the client specifies the number of items to skip (**offset**) and the number of items to return (**limit**) in each request.

```http
GET /api/items?offset=20&limit=10
```

Alternatively, you can use **page** and **page size** parameters instead.

```http
GET /api/items?page=3&page_size=10
```

A SQL database query for offset-based pagination might look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM items 
ORDER BY id 
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

A database in this case will skip the first 20 rows and return the next 10 rows.

**Offest-based pagination** is perfect to deal with small datasets. However, it has some limitations when dealing with large datasets.

Your database have to count and skip rows up to offset before returning the actual result. **The larger your offset, the more inefficient** the query becomes.


**Pros:**
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Allows users to jump to a specific page without having to load all previous pages.

**Cons:**
- Results can be inconsistent if data is added or removed during pagination.
- Performance can degrade as the offset increases, especially with large data sets.

### Cursor-Based Pagination

In cursor-based pagination, the client specifies a **cursor** (such as an ID or timestamp) that points to a specific item in the data set.

```http
GET /api/items?cursor=abc123&limit=10
```

The response includes a set of items along with a new cursor to retrieve the next page.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": "item1"},
    {"id": "item2"},
    ...
  ],
  "next_cursor": "def456"
}
```
