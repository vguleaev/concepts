# Lazy Loading

### What is Lazy Loading?

> This concept will be discussed in the context of Frontend development using React.

**Lazy loading** is a technique to defer the loading of non-critical resources at the initial page load time. 
Instead, these resources are loaded only when they are needed, such as when a user navigates to a specific route or component.

### When to use?

Use lazy loading to improve the initial load time of a web application by deferring the loading of components, routes, or other heavy resources 
until they are actually needed. This technique is particularly useful for large applications with many routes or components.

### How does it work?

In React, lazy loading can be achieved using code splitting and the `React.lazy` function along with `Suspense`. 
Code splitting allows you to split your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand. 
Skeletons can be used to provide a placeholder UI while the actual component is being loaded.

### Code Splitting and Lazy Import

Code splitting can be achieved in two says: **Dynamic imports** and **Route based** code splitting. 
Most bundling tools like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel support code splitting.

Code splitting can be done at the component level using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`: 

```javascript copy
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

// Lazy load the component
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
