# Optimistic Update

### What are Optimistic Updates?

> This concept will be discussed in the context of Frontend development.

**Optimistic update** is a technique used to improve the user experience by immediately updating the UI to reflect a change, assuming that 
the operation will succeed. This approach provides a more responsive and smooth user experience.

### When to use?

Use optimistic updates when you want to provide immediate feedback to the user, such as updating a list of items after adding or 
removing an item, or marking an item as favorite. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the backend operation is 
expected to succeed most of the time.

### How does it work?

When an optimistic update is performed, the UI is updated immediately, and a request is sent to the server to perform the actual operation. 
If the server responds with success, no further action is needed. If the server responds with an error, the UI is reverted to its previous 
state to reflect the failure.

```javascript copy
async function updateItemOptimistically(item) {
  // Update the UI immediately
  updateUI(item);

  // Send the request to the server
  const response = await fetch('/api/items', {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify(item),
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    // Revert the UI if the request fails
    revertUI(item);
  }
}

// Usage
const item = { id: 1, name: 'Updated Item' };
updateItemOptimistically(item);
```

### Cons of Optimistic Updates
- **Data Consistency**: Optimistic updates can lead to temporary inconsistencies between the UI and the server data if the operation fails.
- **Error Handling**: Handling errors and reverting the UI can add complexity to the application logic.
- **User Expectations**: Users may expect immediate updates to be reflected in the server data, leading to confusion if the operation fails.
- **Network Dependency**: Optimistic updates rely on network requests, which can introduce latency and potential failures.
