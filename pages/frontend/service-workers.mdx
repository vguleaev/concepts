# Service Workers

### What are Service Workers?

> This concept will be discussed in the context of Frontend development.

**Service Workers** are a browser-specific technology that acts as a proxy between the web application and the network. 
They run in the background, separate from the main browser thread.

### When to use?

Use Service Workers to enhance the performance and user experience of web applications by enabling **offline access**, 
**intercepting network requests**, **background sync**, **caching**, and **push notifications**.

They are particularly useful for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and applications that require real-time updates or background processing.

### How does it work?

Service workers run in a worker context: they therefore have no DOM access and run on a different thread to the main JavaScript that powers your app. 
They are non-blocking and designed to be fully asynchronous. Service Workers are event-driven and operate independently of the web page.

It takes a form a JavaScript file hat can control the web page/site that it is associated with.

Service worker is registered **once per domain** (per origin). 
All tabs and windows in the same browser that are open to pages from the same origin will share the same service worker.

```javascript copy
// Registering a Service Worker
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
      .then(registration => {
        console.log('Service Worker registered with scope:', registration.scope);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);
      });
  });
}
```

In this example, the Service Worker from file `service-worker.js` is registered when the page loads.

### Key Features
- **Offline Access**: Service Workers can cache resources to enable offline access to web applications.
- **Background Sync**: Synchronize data with the server even when the application is not in the foreground.
- **Push Notifications**: Receive and display notifications to users even when the application is closed.
- **Improved Performance**: Service Workers can cache resources locally, reducing load times and improving performance.
- **Event-Driven**: Service Workers respond to events such as fetch, push, and sync, enabling rich functionalities.

### Example of a Service Worker

Here is an example of a basic **Service Worker** that caches resources for offline access:

```javascript copy
// service-worker.js
const CACHE_NAME = 'my-cache';
const urlsToCache = [
  '/',
  '/styles/main.css',
  '/script/main.js'
];

// This event is triggered when the service worker is first installed (happens once)
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then(cache => {
        return cache.addAll(urlsToCache);
      })
      .then(() => {
        return self.skipWaiting(); // forces the waiting service worker to become the active 
      })
  );
});

// This event is triggered whenever a network request is made.
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(response => {
        return response || fetch(event.request);
      })
  );
});
```
In this example, the Service Worker caches specified resources during the `install` event and serves cached resources during the 
`fetch` event, enabling offline access.

### Service Worker Lifecycle

Service workers have a lifecycle that includes **installation**, **activation**, and **control**. 

When a new service worker is installed, it doesn't immediately take control of the pages.
 Instead, it waits until the old service worker is no longer controlling any pages.

This waiting period prevents the new service worker from disrupting the current user experience by taking control while 
the user is still interacting with the page.

> You can call `self.skipWaiting()` in the install event to make the new service worker activate immediately:


### Example of Custom Event Communication

**Service Workers** can communicate with the main page using custom events. Here's an example of sending a message from the Service Worker to the main page:

```javascript copy
// service-worker.js
self.addEventListener('message', event => {
  if (event.data === 'ping') {
    self.clients.matchAll()
      .then(clients => {
        clients.forEach(client => {
          client.postMessage('pong');
        });
      });
  }
});

// main.js
navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage('ping');

navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('message', event => {
  console.log('Received message from Service Worker:', event.data);
});
```

In this example, the Service Worker listens for a `message` event and responds with a 'pong' message to all connected clients.

### Cons of Service Workers
- **Browser Support**: Service Workers are not supported in all browsers, limiting their availability and functionality.
- **Complexity**: Implementing Service Workers requires understanding of asynchronous programming and event-driven architecture.
- **Security**: Service Workers can introduce security risks if not implemented correctly, such as caching sensitive data or intercepting requests.
- **Debugging**: Debugging Service Workers can be challenging due to their background nature and limited visibility in the browser developer tools.

### Service Worker vs Shared Worker

- Use **Service Workers** for network-related tasks, such as caching, push notifications, and background sync.
- Use **Shared Workers** for real-time communication and shared computations across multiple tabs or iframes.
- **Service Workers** operate at the origin level and can intercept network request for all pages under that origin.
- **Shared Workers** operate at the script level and are shared among all pages that explicably connect to it
