# Debounce 

### What is Debouncing?

> This concept will be discussed in the context of Frontend development.

**Debouncing** is a technique to limit the rate at which a function is executed, ensuring it is only called after a certain period of inactivity.

### When to use?

Use debouncing to prevent a function from being called too frequently, such as in response to rapid user input like scrolling, resizing, or typing.

### How does it work? 

When the debounced function is called, it sets a timer to delay its execution. If the function is called again
before the timer expires, the timer is reset. This process continues until the function is no longer called, 
at which point the function is executed.

```javascript copy
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}

// Usage
const handleResize = debounce(() => {
  console.log('Window resized');
}, 300);

window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
```

In this example `handleResize` is a debounced function that logs "Window resized" after the user has stopped resizing the window for 300ms.


### Debouncing vs Throttling

Debouncing and throttling are similar techniques to limit the rate at which a function is executed, but they differ in how they achieve this.

- **Debouncing** ensures a function is only called after a certain period of inactivity. If the function is called again before the timer expires, the timer is reset.
- **Throttling** ensures a function is called at most once every X milliseconds. If the function is called more frequently, the calls are ignored until the next interval.
