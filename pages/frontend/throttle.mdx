# Throttle

### What is Debouncing?

> This concept will be discussed in the context of Frontend development.

**Throttling** is a technique to limit the rate at which a function is executed, ensuring it is only called at most once in a specified period of time.

### When to use?

Use throttling to prevent a function from being called too frequently, such as reducing amount of requests sent to a server or 
limiting the rate of user input.

### How does it work? 

When the throttled function is called, it checks the time since the last call. If the time is greater than the specified limit, 
the function is executed.


```javascript
function throttle(fn, limit) {
  let lastCall = 0;
  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
      lastCall = now;
      fn(...args);
    }
  };
}

// Usage
const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log('Window scrolled');
}, 300);

window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
```

In this example `handleScroll` is a throttled function that logs "Window scrolled" at most once every 300ms.

### Debouncing vs Throttling

Debouncing and throttling are similar techniques to limit the rate at which a function is executed, but they differ in how they achieve this.

- **Debouncing** ensures a function is only called after a certain period of inactivity. If the function is called again before the timer expires, the timer is reset.
- **Throttling** ensures a function is called at most once every X milliseconds. If the function is called more frequently, the calls are ignored until the next interval.
