# Http Polling

### What is HTTP Polling?

> This concept will be discussed in the context of Frontend development.

**HTTP Polling** is a technique where a client repeatedly requests data from a server at regular intervals. 
This approach is used to keep the client updated with the latest data from the server.

### When to use?

Use HTTP polling when you need to keep the client updated with real-time data, such as live sports scores, stock prices, or chat messages, 
and other real-time updates where WebSockets or Server-Sent Events are not applicable.

### How does it work?

HTTP polling works by sending periodic HTTP requests to the server to check for new data. If new data is available, 
the server responds with the updated data, otherwise it may respond with an empty response or a status indicating no new data.

```javascript copy
async function fetchData(url, callback) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    callback(data);
  }
}

function poll(url, interval, callback) {
  setInterval(() => fetchData(url, callback), interval);
}

// Usage
poll('/api/data', 5000, (data) => {
  console.log('Received data:', data);
});
```

In this example, the poll function sends a request to the specified URL every 5 seconds and calls the provided callback function 
with the received data.

### What is Long Polling?

**Long Polling** is a variation of HTTP polling where the server holds the request open until new data is available or a timeout occurs. 
Once the server responds, the client immediately sends another request, creating a continuous loop of requests.

```javascript copy
async function fetchData(url, callback) {
  const response = await fetch(url); // Server will keep the connection open until new data is available
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    callback(data);
  }
  await fetchData(); // Send the next request immediately
}

// Usage
fetchData('/api/long-poll', (data) => {
  console.log('Received data:', data);
});
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function sends a request to the specified URL and waits for the server to respond with new data. 
Once the response is received, it immediately sends another request, creating a continuous loop.

### HTTP Polling vs Long Polling

HTTP polling and long polling are both techniques to keep the client updated with real-time data, but they differ in how they achieve this.

- **HTTP Polling**: Sends periodic requests to the server at regular intervals, regardless of whether new data is available.
- **Long Polling**: Keeps the request open until the server has new data to send, reducing the number of requests and providing near real-time updates.

### Cons of HTTP Polling

While HTTP polling is a straightforward technique to keep the client updated with real-time data, it has several drawbacks:

- **High Server Load**: Periodic requests can create a significant load on the server, especially if many clients are polling frequently. This can lead to increased server resource usage and potential performance issues.
- **Increased Network Traffic**: Constantly sending requests, even when no new data is available, results in unnecessary network traffic. This can be inefficient and may lead to higher bandwidth usage.
- **Latency**: Since requests are sent at fixed intervals, there can be a delay between when new data is available and when the client receives it. This can result in a less responsive user experience compared to other techniques like long polling or WebSockets.
- **Scalability Issues**: As the number of clients increases, the server must handle a growing number of requests, which can be challenging to scale effectively. This can lead to performance bottlenecks and increased infrastructure costs.
- **Battery Drain**: On mobile devices, frequent polling can lead to increased battery consumption, as the device must constantly wake up to send and receive data.
