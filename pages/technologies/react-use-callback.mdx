# React - useCallback

### What is useCallback?

The `useCallback` hook is a built-in React hook that returns a **memoized version of a callback function**. 

It is used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-creations of functions during re-renders.

It is particularly useful when passing callbacks to child components that rely on reference equality to **prevent unnecessary re-renders**.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ onClick }) {

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // Callback code here
  }, [/* dependencies */]);

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```
- The first argument is the callback function that you want to memoize.
- The second argument is an array of dependencies that determine when the callback should be re-created.

### When the Callback is Re-Created

- The callback function is re-created only when one of the dependencies changes.
- If the dependencies array is empty, the callback will be created only once during the initial render.

### React Strict Mode

In React Strict Mode, the `useCallback` hook will run twice in development mode to help identify side effects that may cause bugs. 

This is similar to how `useEffect` behaves in strict mode.

### useCallback vs useMemo

The `useCallback` hook is often confused with the `useMemo` hook, but they serve different purposes:

- `useCallback` is used to **memoize a function**, preventing it from being re-created unless its dependencies change.
- `useMemo` is used to **memoize a value**, preventing it from being recalculated unless its dependencies change.

> `useMemo` is useful for expensive calculations, while `useCallback` is useful for functions that are passed as props to child components.
