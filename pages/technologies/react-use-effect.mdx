# React - useEffect Hook

### What is useEffect?

The `useEffect` hook is a built-in React hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components. 

It is similar to lifecycle methods in class components, such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

Examples of side effects include data fetching, subscriptions, timers, and DOM manipulations.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effect code here
    return () => {
      // Cleanup code here
    };
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

- The first argument is a function that contains the side effect code.
- The second argument is an array of dependencies. 
- The function can return a cleanup function.


### When the Effect Runs

- After the **initial render**
- After every **re-render** _(when state or props change)_

### React Strict Mode

When using strict mode, the `useEffect` hook will **run twice** in development mode to help identify side effects that may cause bugs.

This is because component is rendered twice in strict mode to detect side effects that depend on the order of execution.

_In React 19 strict mode will be enforced by default._

### Dependency Array

The dependency array is the second argument to useEffect and it controls when the effect function runs:

| Dependency Array           | When Effect Runs                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Not provided               | After every render                                    |
| Empty array `[]`           | Only after the initial render (component mount)       |
| With dependencies `[a, b]` | After initial render and when any dependency changes  |


Notice that not providing a dependency array, which means this effect will run after **every render**.

**Object and Array Dependencies:** Be careful with objects and arrays as dependencies, as they're compared by reference.
An effect will run only when the reference changes, not when the contents of the object or array change.


### Cleanup Function

The cleanup function is used to perform any cleanup or teardown tasks when the component is unmounted or re-rendered.

This is useful for unsubscribing from subscriptions, clearing timers, or removing event listeners.

When Does Cleanup Run?

- Before the **component is removed** (unmounting)
- Before the **effect runs again** (if the effect runs more than once)

Note that cleanup runs every time before the effect runs again.
