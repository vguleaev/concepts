# React - useRef Hook

### What is useRef?

The `useRef` hook is a built-in React hook that allows you to create a mutable reference that **persists** for the lifetime of the component.

It is commonly used to access DOM elements directly or to store mutable values that **do not trigger re-renders** when changed.

Examples of use cases include focusing an input element, storing a timer ID, or keeping track of previous values.

### Basic Syntax

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  return <div ref={myRef}>My Component</div>;
}
```
- The `useRef` hook returns a mutable object with a `current` property.
- The `current` property can be initialized with a value, and it can be updated **without causing a re-render** of the component.

### Accessing DOM Elements

You can use `useRef` to access DOM elements directly:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Focus the input element on mount
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }, []);

  return <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />;
}
```

### Storing Values

You can also use `useRef` to store values that you want to persist across re-renders without triggering a re-render when the value changes:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function DebouncedInput() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');
  const timeoutRef = useRef(null);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setValue(e.target.value);

    if (timeoutRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);
    }

    timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Debounced:', e.target.value);
    }, 500);
  };

  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
```

### useRef vs useCallback

`useRef` and `useCallback` are both hooks that can be used to optimize performance in React, but they serve different purposes:

- `useRef` is used to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders, allowing you to store values or access DOM elements without triggering re-renders.
- `useCallback` is used to memoize a function so that it does not get recreated on every render, which can help prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that depend on that function.


### When to Use useRef
- When you need to access a DOM element directly.
- When you want to store a mutable value that does not require re-rendering the component.
- When you need to keep track of previous values without triggering re-renders.
