# Graph 

### Graph (Data Structure)

**Graph** is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (nodes) and edges (links).

> Graphs are used to represent networks, social networks, maps, and many more real-world applications.

Graphs are used to model **relationships** between entities. A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.

### Types of Graphs

1. **Undirected Graph**: A graph in which edges have no direction.
2. **Directed Graph**: A graph in which edges have a direction.
3. **Weighted Graph**: A graph in which edges have weights.
4. **Acyclic Graph**: A graph that has no cycles.

**Tree** is undirected graph with no cycles, where each node has exactly one parent.

### Representing Graph

Graphs can be represented using different data structures:
- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array of size `V x V` where `V` is the number of vertices.
- **Adjacency List**: An array of linked lists where the size of the array is equal to the number of vertices.

```python
#         0
#        / 
#       1 --- 2
#        \   /
#          3

# Adjacency Matrix representation
graph = [[0, 1, 0, 0],
         [1, 0, 1, 1],
         [0, 1, 0, 1],
         [0, 1, 1, 0]]

# Adjacency List representation
graph = {0: [1],
         1: [0, 2, 3],
         2: [1, 3],
         3: [1, 2]}
```

### Operations

1. **Add Vertex**: Add a new vertex to the graph.
2. **Add Edge**: Add an edge between two vertices.
3. **Remove Vertex**: Remove a vertex from the graph.
4. **Remove Edge**: Remove an edge between two vertices.
5. **Traverse**: Visit all vertices in a specific order.

### Example

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        if u not in self.graph:
            self.graph[u] = [v]
        else:
            self.graph[u].append(v)

    def print_graph(self):
        for node in self.graph:
            print(node, "->", " -> ".join(map(str, self.graph[node])))

# Create a graph
g = Graph()

g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.add_edge(1, 2)
g.add_edge(2, 0)

g.print_graph()
```

### Traversing a Graph

There are two common ways to traverse a graph:

- **Depth First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**


**Depth First Search (DFS)** is a recursive traversal strategy in which we start
from a node and then traverse the graph as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
At each step, we visit an adjacent node that we have not visited before.

**Breadth First Search (BFS)** is a traversal strategy that explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth level 
before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
We achieve this by maintaining a queue of the edges connected to the node that we are visiting. 
We then pickup the next vertex to visit from the queue.

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        if u not in self.graph:
            self.graph[u] = [v]
        else:
            self.graph[u].append(v)

    def dfs(self, node, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        print(node, end=" ")

        for neighbor in self.graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                self.dfs(neighbor, visited)

    def bfs(self, start):
        visited = set()
        queue = [start]
        visited.add(start)

        while queue:
            node = queue.pop(0)
            print(node, end=" ")

            for neighbor in self.graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)

```
