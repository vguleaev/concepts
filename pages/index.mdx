# Concepts
 
Welcome to **Concepts for Software Engineers** from [Vladislav Guleaev](https://github.com/vguleaev)! 

This is a collection of tech **concepts**, **philisopsies** and **patterns** in software development explained in my own words. 

Here I cover high-level concepts that are not tied to a specific technology, making them applicable to any project. 
Abstractions play a crucial role in effectively communicating with software engineers and understanding high-level system design.

## Why this project?

As a software engineer, I've realized that endlessly following tutorials for a new framework isn't the best way to learn. 
With the vast number of technologies available today, it's impossible to stay updated on all of them. 
This approach consumes a lot of time and creates stress. Often, understanding the **concept** or main idea behind a technology is sufficient.

I created this project to help me concentrate on ideas and concepts rather than specific frameworks and libraries.
