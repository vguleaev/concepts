# RDBMS vs NoSQL

### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

**RDBMS** is a type of database management system that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.

Characteristics:

- **Structured Data**: Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
- **Schema**: A predefined schema defines the structure of the data.
- **ACID Properties**: Transactions are processed following the ACID properties _(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)_.

**Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, MS SQL Server

### NoSQL Database

**NoSQL** is a type of database that stores and retrieves data in a non-tabular format. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured data.

Data in NoSQL databases can be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.

Characteristics:

- **Unstructured Data**: Data is stored in a flexible format like JSON, key-value pairs, or documents.
- **Schema-less**: No predefined schema is required.
- **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally.

**Examples**: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB, Couchbase

### Differences

| RDBMS | NoSQL |
|-------|-------|
| Structured Data | Unstructured Data |
| Predefined Schema | Schema-less |
| ACID Properties | Eventual Consistency |
| Vertical Scaling | Horizontal Scaling |
| SQL Queries | NoSQL Queries |
| Transactions | No Transactions |

> Not every NoSql database is not ACID compliant, but most of them are not. MongoDB introduced multi-document transactions in version 4.0.

### What is ACID?

**ACID** is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. It stands for:

- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are.
- **Consistency**: The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Transactions are processed independently without interference, handling concurrent transactions.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and survive system failures (e.g. outage, crash).

### CAP Theorem

**CAP Theorem** states that in a distributed system, it is impossible to guarantee all three of the following:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without guarantee of the data being the latest.
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions (failures, delays).

NoSQL databases are designed to be **AP** (Availability and Partition Tolerance) systems following **Eventual Consistency (BASE)**, 
while RDBMS focuses on **CP** (Consistency and Partition Tolerance) following **ACID**.

> No distributed system is safe from network failures, thus network partitioning generally has to be tolerated.

### ACID vs BASE

- **ACID**: Guarantees consistency and reliability of transactions.
- **BASE**: Focuses on availability, soft state, and eventual consistency.
  - **Basically Available**: The system remains operational even in case of failures.
  - **Soft State**: The system can be in an inconsistent state during updates.
  - **Eventual Consistency**: The system will become consistent over time.

### When to use RDBMS?

- When the data is structured and requires a predefined schema.
- When the application requires complex queries and transactions.
- When the data is relational and requires ACID properties.

### When to use NoSQL?

- When the data is unstructured and schema-less.
- When the application requires horizontal scalability.
- When the data is document-oriented or key-value pairs.
