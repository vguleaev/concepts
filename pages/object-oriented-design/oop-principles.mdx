# OOP Principles

### What is Object-Oriented Programming?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," 
which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. OOP aims to increase the modularity, 
reusability, and maintainability of code by organizing it into objects and classes.

### Core OOP Principles

There are four core principles of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the implementation details of a class properties and 
methods by restricting access to class data. Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, 
and `public`.

```typescript copy
class Person {
  private name: string;
  private age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  public getName(): string {
    return this.name;
  }

  public setName(name: string): void {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public getAge(): number {
    return this.age;
  }

  public setAge(age: number): void {
    this.age = age;
  }
}
```

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (child) inherits the properties and 
behaviors of an existing class (parent). This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical 
relationship between classes.

```typescript copy
class Animal {
    public eat(): void {
        console.log("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public bark(): void {
        console.log("The dog barks.");
    }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.eat(); // Inherited method
dog.bark(); // Subclass method
```

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a 
common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types). 
Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

```typescript copy
class Animal {
    public makeSound(): void {
        console.log("This animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public makeSound(): void {
        console.log("The cat meows.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public makeSound(): void {
        console.log("The dog barks.");
    }
}

const myCat: Animal = new Cat();
const myDog: Animal = new Dog();

myCat.makeSound(); // Outputs: The cat meows.
myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: The dog barks.
```

4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details behind a simpler interface. 
It allows the programmer to write code for abstractions, not actual implementations. 
Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

```typescript copy
abstract class Shape {
    abstract draw(): void;
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    public draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public draw(): void {
        console.log("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

const circle: Shape = new Circle();
const rectangle: Shape = new Rectangle();

circle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a circle.
rectangle.draw(); // Outputs: Drawing a rectangle.
```
